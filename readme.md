# Data
The data are download from [10x website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/pbmc33k).

# Reproducibility
The code to reproduce the expriments are organized in `code` directory.

# Supplementary
The conference paper and supplementary can be found in `pdf` directory.

In addition to the above biological explorations, we carried out two scenarios (SIM I and II) with [Splatter](https://github.com/Oshlack/splatter) to demonstrate that resistant fit normalization works under extreme differential expression and extreme drop-out rate. The simulation results are organized in the supplementary for readers' reference.
